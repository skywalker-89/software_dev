    -Recommendation
    For a balance of ease of implementation and high effectiveness, I recommend:

    Use Google Cloud Vision API for image recognition and similarity.
    It’s easy to integrate with your app and highly accurate.
    Combine with text-based similarity (using libraries like string-similarity) to cross-check item descriptions.

5. gamification system
    if a user found an item and gave it back the another user
    that person will gain 10 points and that 10 points might be claimable as a reward 
    to get a free drinks or discount on food at local business and venue

If users lose items of high value (e.g., electronics, jewelry), suggest affordable insurance plans within the app.

Encourage users to add reward offers for found items:
Example: A user offers $20 to someone who returns a lost wallet.
Charge a small commission (e.g., 5–10%) for facilitating successful claims.
